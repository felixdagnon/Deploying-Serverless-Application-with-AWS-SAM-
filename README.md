Deploying  Serverless Application with AWS SAM Serverless Application Model: A Step-by-Step

##  What is SAM

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. 

It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. 

With just a few lines per resource, you can define the application you want and model it using YAML. 

During deployment, AWS SAM transforms and expands the SAM syntax into AWS CloudFormation syntax,

enabling you to save time and build, test, and deploy serverless applications faster.
